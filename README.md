My first attempt at creating an adblocker through ruleset and manifest files. 

##How to add to your Chrome Extensions

Since this extension is still not ready made for Google Chrome Extension Store, feel free to download this repo. After retrieving the repo, you can go to chrome://extensions/ and toggle 'Developer Mode'. After enabling Developer Mode, please select 'Load unpacked' and voila! You now have my awesome ad blocker :) Have fun web browsing ad-free!
